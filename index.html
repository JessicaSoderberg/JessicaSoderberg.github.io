I'm a film maker in Wellington, New Zealand, looking to push my creative limits. I have been involved with filming live events, documentaries and short films all over Wellington. I'm skilled in both camera operation and behind-the-scenes production work. Currently, I study a Bachelor of Creative Media Production at Massey University's Wellington campus. </p1> <br> <br> <p2>
I've been interested in leading a creative career since the beginning. I've always been heavily involved in creative outputs like acting and designing, and now I turn all my efforts to film. I have grown up in Wellington, surrounded by the most quirky and eccentric artists that this small city has to offer! </p2>
